effectiveness of this system, devices such as light switches, power

<H1 CLASS="western">             <FONT SIZE=6 STYLE="font-size: 28pt">Introduction</FONT></H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><FONT SIZE=6 STYLE="font-size: 22pt">The
internet of things (IoT) can be described as connecting everyday
objects like smart phones, internet TVs , sensors and actuators to
the internet where the devices are intelligently linked together
enabling new forms of communication between things and people, and
between things themselves. Building IoT has advanced significantly in
the last couple pf years since it has added a new dimension to the
world of information and communication technologies.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><FONT SIZE=6 STYLE="font-size: 22pt">The
internet has come a long way over the last 30 years. Old fashioned
IPv4 is giving way to IPv6 so that every device on the internet can
have its own IP address. Machine to machine (M2M) communication is on
the rise, enabling devices to exchange and act upon information
without a person ever being involved. The scope and scale of the
internet have changed as well: industry leaders predict that the
number of connected devices will surpass 15 billion nodes by 2015 and
reach over 50 billion by 2020. The challenge for the embedded
industry is to unlock the value of this growing interconnected web of
devices, often referred to as the internet of things (IoT),
describing it as the ultimate tool in our future surveillance. This
network has the power to reshape our cities.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">  <FONT SIZE=6 STYLE="font-size: 22pt">At
the edge of the IoT are the appliances and equipment we use everyday.
 These &ldquo;things&rdquo; are interconnected across an
infrastructure of backbone using combinations of ZigBee, sub-GHz,
Wi-Fi or power line communications(PLC) connectivity to provide a
robust bi-directional communications link with relatively long range,
low latency for fast responsiveness, low power and a sufficient data
rate to aggregate information from many connected devices.  This
infrastructure also serves as the gateway to the internet and enables
remote monitoring and control of devices by other networks, utility
companies and end users.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">     <FONT SIZE=6 STYLE="font-size: 22pt">Home
automation or smart homes can be described as introduction of
technology within the home environment to provide convenience,
comfort, security and energy efficiency to its occupants. Adding
intelligence to home environment can provide increased quality of
life. With the introduction of the IoT, the research and
implementation of home automation are getting more popular.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=1 STYLE="font-size: 0pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><FONT SIZE=6 STYLE="font-size: 22pt">The
introduction of home automation in the 1970s failed to improve the
life styles of users for several reasons. Firstly, determining
economic benefits of home automation technologies is difficult.
Secondly, the costs of implementing smart home technology must be
justified by the effects brought about by their installation. There
is a infrastructures and appliances.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">                 <FONT SIZE=6 STYLE="font-size: 22pt">In
2003, housing learning and improvement network published a smart home
definition offered by interetec which states that a smart home is &ldquo;a
dwelling incorporating a communications network that connects the key
electrical appliances and services , and allows them to be remotely
controlled, monitored or accessed&rdquo;. The following section
includes a brief summary of previous research into smart homes within
the past decade.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">              <FONT SIZE=6 STYLE="font-size: 22pt">In
1995, welfare techno houses were constructed in Japan. The purpose of
these experiments was to provide health monitoring for elderly and
disabled person at home by using fully automated measurements to
support daily health care and improve quality of life. The University
of Texas at Arlington has conducted the MavHome project over the past
7 years. The MavHome (Managing and Adaptive Versatile home) is a home
environment that detects environment states through sensors and
intelligently acts upon the environment though controllers. The
sensors in the home form and adhoc network with interconnect together
to make appropriate decisions.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><FONT SIZE=6>The focus of my project
is on helping users to operate home appliances with their own smart
phones and to help elderly or handicapped people live a more
independent life as long as possible. The objective of our system is
to take care of several domestic systems that may normally be
difficult for those who are handicap or elderly to take care of. The
proposed idea will allow a user with any android enabled device to
run a piece of downloadable software on any mobile device such as
smart phones. This application will allow the user to control a
device that is connected to any home appliance that is Pi enabled.
The focus of this application will be to direct a security system
with Webcam surveillance, door sensor notification and light control
system. Sensors will be connected to the home appliances with Pi so
that they can be monitored and controlled.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">                 <FONT SIZE=6>Suppose
an employee who has gone to work and during this period a thief
sneaks up into the house breaking through a window. The proposed
system would enable the client to monitor his home when a door or a
window sensor triggers the alarm. Client monitors his home with web
cam and could immediately inform local authority or a policeman.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">             <FONT SIZE=6>The client
could also check the status of the outside light and turn on and off
the light without the need to get out of bed. These devices would
also benefit users with limited mobility that may have a difficult
time getting to or even reaching their light switch.  These
objectives require a large amount of technology. The user interface
must be as simple and powerful as possible and operate in a self
organized way. </FONT>

wall switch electrical box. There are several ways this could be
improved in future work. The use of surface mount components would
dramatically decrease the overall size of the components. Surface
mount components are also often less expensive as they require less
material to produce. This would help reduce the overall cost of the
devices as well as the size. Another area to help improve the size is
the circuit board that is used currently for the prototype; a generic
breadboard style board was used.</FONT></P>
